## Notes on this [Calculator](https://hashlog5.github.io/Calculator/) app

- Scroll left/right to view expressions that are longer than the display screen.
- It can parse implicit multiplication as well as the negative of numbers, roots, and groupings.
- It will prevent the user from making invalid syntax entries.
- It will display "Incomplete" when evaluating incomplete expressions.
- It will display "Undefined" when evaluating expressions involving division by zero, complex numbers, or numbers considered as "infinity" by JavaScript.
